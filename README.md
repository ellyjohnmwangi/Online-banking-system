## How to install
1. Open the Github repository containing the source code in your web browser and click on the "Code" button. This will open a dropdown menu that will allow you to copy the repository's URL.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to download the repository using the ```cd``` command.
3. Clone the repository using the git clone command followed by the URL you copied in step 1. For example, if the URL is https://github.com/user/repo.git, you would run the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```
